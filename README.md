# NixOS Dotfiles

Hello and welcome! Here you are looking at the probably poorly formatted readme for the dotfiles I use and tweak essentially daily. I will add more install instructions as this becomes more set in stone, but for now just know that you can use these if you want to replicate my work in progress XMonad setup or my 5 year old perfection that is the AwesomeWM dots. 

## Screeshots

This is some XMonad on some ThinkPad.

And here is the AwesomeWM config

I am keeping this here for historical purposes or for people who want to download the repo with the AwesomeWM dots but found this instead. 

# Installation & Details

This is where things need to be improved. 

1. Come up with an easy install method for replicating this without manually doing everything
2. Fix wierd things XMonad is doing for reasons unclear to me 
3. Get more wild with things in the status bar.
4. Find out how to script so one can do a simple ```./setup.sh``` or something when in this folder and everything will move to the correct spots. 

## AwesomeWM

I have decided to take the AwesomeWM dots out of this repoistory as they have been around a long time and are sort of now spread across, in different degrees of *up-to-date-ness* around on GitHub and I think that my learning of how to organize these things has improved along with the dotfiles. As I am now going to use XMonad for a while, the dots will stay the same for AwesomeWM and can be cloned at ```https://github.com/ubuntu9786/4k_config.git``` and here I am going to keep the non 4k XMonad config files. As these always evolve over time, I often found myself overwriting things in unrelated configs and so I am now going to keep them separate. 


Thats it for now!
