# NixOS Dotfiles

Hello and welcome! Here you are looking at the probably poorly formatted readme for the dotfiles I use and tweak essentially daily. I will add more install instructions as this becomes more set in stone, but for now just know that you can use these if you want to replicate my work in progress XMonad setup or my 5 year old perfection that is the AwesomeWM dots. 

## Screeshots

This is some XMonad on some ThinkPad.

And here is the AwesomeWM config

# Installation & Details

This is where things need to be improved. 

1. Come up with an easy install method for replicating this without manually doing everything
2. Fix wierd things XMonad is doing for reasons unclear to me 
3. Get more wild with things in the status bar.


Thats it for now!
